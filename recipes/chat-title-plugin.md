# Recipe: let the agent name the chat, early (`chat-title` plugin)

**Goal (Tali, 2026-09-24):** a plugin that lets agents rename the chat title,
and *strongly* encourages them to name the chat at the beginning — as soon as
the conversation carries the minimum context needed to name it.

Plugin: `~/github/tali-dash-plugins/plugins/chat-title/` (package
`tali-chat-title`; the README owns the tool contract, config and the
human-vs-agent rule). This recipe owns the survey, the design choices and the
headless verification method.

## Survey: the seams a host plugin has

Checked against the source checkout (`deepseek-harness/`, fork branch
`feat/embed-session`, 2026-09-24):

| Fact | Where |
|---|---|
| `ctx.sessionTitle.rename(session, title)` appends `session/title` with `source.kind: 'user'`; that **pins** the title (in-flight automatic generation is superseded, later prompts schedule none). `refresh()` is the only unpin. There is no "agent" source kind — the service knows `fallback`, `provider`, `user`. | `packages/session/session-title/src/index.ts` |
| A tool body receives `exec.agent.session` (the live session) — the same handle `fs-tools` uses for the cwd. | `packages/core/tools/src/index.ts` `ToolExecutionInput.agent` |
| `session.header.parentSession` marks a subagent session. | `packages/core/session/src/types.ts` |
| `output.presentationMeta(args, value)` is persisted as `tool/result.meta` (skipped for nested PTC dispatches). | `docs/cookbook/adding-a-tool.md`, tools `index.ts` ~1815 |
| `ctx.systemPrompt.section({ name, order, text })` — `text` may be a function of the `AssembleContext`, which the agent loop extends with `agent` (`context.agent?.session`, as `sandbox-policy` reads it). | `packages/core/system-prompt/src/index.ts`, `packages/sandbox/sandbox-policy/src/index.ts` |
| `ctx.systemPrompt.context({ name, order, text })` contributes to the **runtime-context snapshot**: a plugin-sourced user message re-emitted only when the joined text changes (`RuntimeContextProjection.project`). Empty text contributes nothing. | `packages/core/agent-loop/src/runtime-context.ts` |
| The `base` bundle mounts `session-title` + `session-title-first-prompt-llm`, so `web` and `headless` both have `ctx.sessionTitle`. The live profile sets `style: slug` on the LLM titler. | `packages/bundle/base/cordis.patch.yml`, `~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml` |

## Design

Three pieces, one plugin, all host-side:

1. **`rename_chat` tool** — styles the title (`slug` default, matching the
   live profile's slug convention; `natural` optional), calls
   `ctx.sessionTitle.rename` on the agent's own top-level session, and
   records the applied title in `tool/result.meta.chatTitle`.
2. **System-prompt section** — worded as a rule ("You MUST … as your first
   tool call … a chat that ends its first turn still untitled is a failure"),
   with the explicit vague-opening exception ("name it the moment the goal
   becomes clear"). Static text; only top-level agents see it.
3. **Runtime-context nudge** — while the title source is `fallback` /
   `provider` (or none), one constant line in the runtime-context snapshot.
   Constant on purpose: including the current placeholder title would make
   the snapshot change when the LLM titler lands (fallback → provider) and
   cost a cache break per change; the constant text costs exactly two
   (appear / disappear) per chat.

### Why "user"-sourced titles need a plugin-side distinction

`rename` can only write `source.kind: 'user'`, so a title the *human* chose
(sidebar Rename, `session-title-slug`'s `slug:` prefix) and a title the
*agent* chose look identical in the log. The agent must never override the
human's, but must be allowed to rename over its own when the subject moves.
Resolution: the tool persists what it applied in `tool/result.meta.chatTitle`
(`presentationMeta`), and classifies the standing title by scanning the
session events (`agentTitlesOf` → `classifyTitle` in `title.mjs`): a
`user`-sourced title matching a persisted `meta.chatTitle` is the agent's,
anything else `user`-sourced is the human's. Restart-proof, no side file.

### Rejected alternatives

- **Registering a `SessionTitleProvider`** (`ctx.sessionTitle.register`) —
  the service accepts one provider; the in-tree LLM titler already holds the
  slot, and a provider generates from *human messages* on the service's
  cadence, not on the agent's judgement of "enough context".
- **`agent.inject` reminders from a `agent/turn-stopping` hook** — durable
  user messages pile up in the log every turn; the runtime-context snapshot
  is the seam built for exactly this ("dynamic context, re-emitted when it
  changes").
- **Hiding the tool from subagents via scope** — the global registry is
  simpler; the tool refuses with `CHAT_TITLE_SUBAGENT` and the section/nudge
  text providers return `''` when `header.parentSession` is set.
- **A `force` flag to override the human's title** — a model would use it.
  The refusal is final; the human can always rename.

## Build / test

```sh
cd ~/github/tali-dash-plugins/plugins/chat-title
pnpm install && pnpm run check     # node --test: styling, classification, tool paths, apply wiring
```

## Headless end-to-end (the method that worked)

The preview server's default model has no tools, so the tool path was
verified headlessly against a throwaway home with forwarded credentials
(PREVIEWING.md):

```sh
H=/tmp/chat-title-home; mkdir -p $H /tmp/chat-title-tmp
cp ~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml ~/.dsh/settings.yaml $H/
cat > /tmp/chat-title-overlay.yml <<'EOF'
- insert:
    - id: tali-chat-title
      name: '/Users/<user>/github/tali-dash-plugins/plugins/chat-title/index.js'
EOF
cd ~/github/tali-dash-plugins/deepseek-harness
TMPDIR=/tmp/chat-title-tmp DSH_HOME=$H node --import tsx/esm apps/cli/src/bin.ts \
  --profile headless --patch /tmp/chat-title-overlay.yml --dump-config | grep -A2 chat-title
TMPDIR=/tmp/chat-title-tmp DSH_HOME=$H node --import tsx/esm apps/cli/src/bin.ts \
  --profile headless --patch /tmp/chat-title-overlay.yml \
  "Please read /tmp/chat-title-ws/notes.py and tell me in one sentence what it contains."
zstd -dc $H/sessions/*/session-*/session.v3.jsonl.zstd \
  | grep -o '"type":"\(session/title\|tool/call\)".\{0,160\}'
```

Observed (Claude via OpenRouter): `session/title` fallback (seq 14) →
provider title from `session-title-first-prompt-llm` (seq 16) → **`tool/call
rename_chat {"title":"summarize-notes-py"}` in turn 1 step 1, issued together
with the first `read`** → `session/title` `{"source":{"kind":"user"}}` →
`tool/result` with `meta: {"chatTitle":"summarize-notes-py"}`. The first
runtime-context snapshot (seq 10) listed sections
`sandbox:policy, approval:policy, chat-title:nudge`; the second (seq 25,
after the rename) had only the first two. A second run with the prompt
`hi there` produced no `rename_chat` call and a plain greeting reply — the
vague-opening exception works and the nudge stays armed.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dsh …` in the checkout fails with `× create the temporary package manager install directory … Operation not permitted` | pnpm 12's version manager tries to install the `packageManager`-pinned pnpm 11 into a temp dir the agent sandbox denies. Bypass pnpm: run the script's command directly — `node --import tsx/esm apps/cli/src/bin.ts …` **from the checkout root** (tsconfig `paths` resolution; from another cwd you get `does not provide an export named 'FiberState'` or `Cannot find package 'tsx'`). |
| `error: unknown option '--cwd'` | The headless profile takes no cwd flag; the session cwd is the process cwd. Reference files by absolute path in the task instead. |
| Model never calls `rename_chat` | Check the system prompt contains the `Chat title (rename_chat)` section (a `system/message` event) and that the runtime-context snapshot lists `chat-title:nudge`. If the section is missing, `ctx.tools.get(toolName, scope)` returned undefined — the tool is hidden in that scope (preset tool filter). |
| Tool answers `Not renamed: the user named this chat …` although nobody did | A `user`-sourced title with no matching `tool/result.meta.chatTitle`: another plugin renamed with `rename` (e.g. `session-title-slug`'s prefix), or the rename ran as a PTC sub-dispatch (no meta persisted) before a restart. By design; rename in the sidebar if it matters. |
| Preview (`~/.dsh-preview`, :3088) shows the section but the model ignores it | The preview's Apple Foundation model has no tools (`minimal-no-tools`); use the headless method above. |

## Status

- Built, unit-tested (9 tests), verified end to end headlessly (task prompt
  → renamed in step 1; greeting → not renamed).
- **Live since 2026-09-24** (Tali: "make it live"): installed into the `web`
  profile as a bundle — `node --import tsx/esm apps/cli/src/bin.ts plugin
  --profile web add <plugins>/plugins/chat-title` from the checkout (the
  `pnpm dsh` wrapper hits the temp-dir trap above; the write under
  `~/.dsh/profiles/web` needed one sandbox approval). `chat-title` is in
  `tools/install-plugins.sh`'s live set, so `pnpm install-plugins` reproduces
  it on another Mac. A bundle add is a **boot-time** change, yet the plugin was
  active in the running server within the same session: the very next request
  of the installing chat carried the `chat-title:nudge` runtime context, its
  `rename_chat` call renamed the live session, and the nudge was gone from
  the following snapshot — profile bundle changes are picked up live
  (same observation as `brand-kit-plugin.md`'s "new bundle row taking effect
  live without a restart").
- The `cordis.dev.yml` row remains for the preview home (`~/.dsh-preview`),
  which does not carry the bundle — one home gets one or the other, never both.
- `--dump-config` on the live profile fails with `EPERM … profiles/web/cordis.yml`
  from an agent sandbox (read denied outside the workspace); run it from a
  terminal to list the composed rows.
